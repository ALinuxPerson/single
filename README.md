# The Single Package Manager
This is a package manager meant to unify all package managers in a system into one simple package manager for you to use.

# What are it's uses then?
There are several uses to this:
 - To unify all existing package managers into one package manager as said above
 - To make it easier to find packages without hunting down multiple package managers
 - To just make life easier
